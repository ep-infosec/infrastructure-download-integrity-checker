Test tree

This contains the data necessary to run local tests.
- checker.yaml: points to local dist dir, but is otherwise a copy of the main file
- email-template.txt: links to main copy
- results.yaml: expected results
- dist/ test tree; must contain incubator directory
- keys/: various generated keys

The keys/ directory contains public and private keys.
In each case the password is the same as the key name, e.g. the password for Absent is Absent.
The key names indicate how they are intended to be used.

Absent - not present in the KEYS file(s); non-expiring
Present - present in the KEYS file(s); non-expiring
Expired - present in the KEYS file(s); expired 2022-07-16
Extended - NOT present in the KEYS file(s); extended version of Expired which expired 2022-07-21
Subkeys - present in KEYS files; main key is non expiring, 
          but there are 7 subkeys that expired between 2022-07-21 and 2022-07-27
          plus one non-expiring subkey
          
dist/ant/ contains a valid set of sigs/hashes, but no KEYS file

dist/httpd/ contains various test cases.
Generally the file name indicates which key was used to sign the file.
For example:
test_absent.zip.asc was signed using the Absent key.
test_subkey0.zip.asc was signed using the main Subkeys key
test_subkey1.zip.asc was signed using the 1st Subkeys sub-key
test_subkey8.zip.asc was signed using the non-expiring Subkeys sub-key

test_date.zip.asc contains a date instead of a valid sig
test_empty.zip.asc is an empty file
test_wrong.zip.asc is a copy of test_present.zip.asc, but the corresponding file test_wrong.zip is empty

There are a few other test files.

N.B. At present only .zip files are present; this was chosen as a representative extension that must have verification
At some point other extensions should be added to check that the script can detect bad sigs and hashes.

To run the test runner script:

cd tests
python test.py --debug --quiet
